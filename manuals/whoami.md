Hi, Im Thomas.

I go by the online name HexF. I'm a high school student with a passion in Sysadmin, DevOps and Software Development.

## HexF?

Yes, my online name is HexF, or 0xF or 15. I came up with this name to replace my old name, which came from the old family computer's name `lounge` and my name, `thomas`, split by an underscore, making `lounge_thomas`.

That name stuck for a while, until I thought it deserved a refresh, I didn't use it very widely online making it easy to change.

HexF came from me wanting a 4 letter name in `Minecraft` to be with the cool kids. I knew I wanted it to be computer related, some contenders were `0b11` and `HexZ`, but HexF sounded right.
