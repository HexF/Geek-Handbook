# The Geek Handbook

The Geek Handbook is a collection of guides on building out your infrastructure for your homelab, or your startup.
This handbook is me (and you) documenting the setup and usage of many sysadminy applications to help improve your workflow.

## Who is this for

This handbook is not for people that want to run a plex server at home, or an autopirate stack - [Funkypenguin's Geek Cookbook](https://github.com/funkypenguin/geek-cookbook) already does a great job at this!
The handbook is for people who want to modernize their homelabs or current deployments.

## What do I need to know

We assumes you already know a bit about [virtual machines](https://vmware.com) and [docker](https://docker.io).
You will also need to know your way around a linux terminal (WSL works too!)

On most manuals, these will do - others might requrie a more extensive knowledge of other technologies (i.e. x509 certificates, SSL etc.)
But don't worry, the manuals are here to help you learn!

## What the manual covers

This handbook covers a vast range of topics, from deployng your own internal Certificate Authority, to managing SSH at scale, all the way to automated systems deployment. This handbook covers it all!

## Whats the catch

Nothing, this handbook is entirely free* for you to read.
However, some manuals have automated deployment scripts (ansible), which are available when you support me.

\* While it is free, you can still support me! Shoot me an email at [hello@hexf.me](mailto:hello@hexf.me) to find out how!

## Cool! Sign me up

Make your way over to [the website](https://geek-handbook.hexf.me) and get reading!

## Got an idea for a manual

Great, make a feature request [here](https://github.com/HexF/Geek-Handbook/issues/new) and I'll be sure to look into it!
